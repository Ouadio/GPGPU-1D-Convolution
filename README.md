# Parallel Pattern : Convolution
## A set of Parallelized 1D Convolution implementations using CUDA 
### I. Naive basic implementation  
### II. Tiled implementation  
### III. Simplified Tiled implementation 
### IV. Tiled implementation with dynamic shared memory usage 
-----------
+ **In progress** : 

    + (Bug) Fixing erronous results when using large arrays with tiled implementations.  
    + (Test) Including GTest/GMock suites as project submodule.
    + (Code Quality) Refactoring source code, seperating kernels from wrappers, re-organizing project structure.
