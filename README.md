# Parallel Pattern : Convolution
## A set of Parallelized 1D Convolution implementations using CUDA with basic performance benchmarking  
### 0. Naive Sequential implementation  
### I. Naive basic implementation  
### II. Tiled implementation  
### III. Simplified Tiled implementation 
### IV. Tiled implementation with dynamic shared memory usage  
### V. Nested Loop implementation (more work per thread)  
-----------
+ **In progress** : 
    + (Test) Including GTest/GMock suites as project submodule.
    + (Code Quality) Refactoring source code, seperating kernels from wrappers, re-organizing project structure.
    + (Advanced Performance Metrics)
